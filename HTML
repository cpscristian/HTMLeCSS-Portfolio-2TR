                Calamitas is of similarly unknown origins. It is speculated that she came from Azafure, however the only proof of this 
                is her immense control of brimstone magic. 

                Speaking of that control, Calamitas was a very peculiar person. Even as a little child, she was ridiculously powerful.
                So powerful in fact, that Yharim decided to force her into his ranks out of sheer desperation, 
                probably prompted by the Devourer of Gods.

                Calamitas was trained and basically adopted by the archmage, Permafrost, who was also in Yharim's army. 
                He helped hone her humongous strength and acted like her father figure, being the only friendly person to her. 

                After some time, Yharim decided to use Calamitas for the first time during his war against Ilmeris, the ocean city 
                that became the sunken sea. She managed to oblitherate most of the city by herself. 
                This was when Yharim realised the true potential of the witch.
                This potential would be utilized again, however this time by complete accident. 
                
                Azafure was an ally of the Godseeker that met an unfortunate end after Calamitas suddenly stumbled upon an attack 
                by the city' protector, the Brimstone Elemental. Landing between a rock and a hard place, Calamitas was forced to 
                defend herself and the recoil of the battle destroyed the city.

                After these events, and due to Yharim losing his morals, Calamitas and Permafrost left his ranks. 
                The Godseeker did not take this lightly and forced the witch to kill her mentor. 
                She refused however and simply trapped him in an eternal icy prison - Cryogen.

                Calamitas' mental state has taken severe tolls on her over time caused by Yharim's actions. 
                When she saw you, getting so powerful, she was reminded of him. 
                Not wanting the world to suffer again due to someone like Yharim, she decided to get rid of you herself. 
                After the battle, she saw that you weren't exactly like him after all and maybe there was indeed hope 
                of ending his catastrophic crusade once and for all.
